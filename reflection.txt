The application could be further improved by implementing the following:
- Add a Web UI for a smoother user experience, so users can input snippets and receive instant, structured feedback without touching the CLI.
- Give user the liberty to choose how they want their codes reviewed.
- Expand the quality flags to cover dimensions like efficiency and robustness for more actionable reviews.
- Add a fallback model if primary one fails.
- Add a fourth output field called fixed code that returns a the corrected or improved version if the code is buggy or needs improvement.
